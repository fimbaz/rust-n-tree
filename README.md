# N-Tree

> A quadtree-like structure of arbitrary arity

## [Documentation](https://crates.fyi/crates/ntree/0.1.0)

## Overview

Provides the `Region` trait and `NTree` type, usable for quickly indexing
data based on multiple attributes and finding nearest neighbors by many
metrics, such as 3-dimensional collision detection.

## Examples

See the test fixtures for an example quadtree implementation created as a
simple specialization of n-tree.
